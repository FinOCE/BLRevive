# BLRevive Launcher - CANCELLED

A BLR server controller built using Typescript based off [MajiKau's discord.py controller](https://github.com/MajiKau/BLRE-Server-Info-Discord-Bot/), using the patched server created by [BLRevive](https://gitlab.com/blrevive).

This launcher is no longer being developed because the main BLRevive developer returned and is implementing the system directly into the launcher, so no need for this to be continued.
